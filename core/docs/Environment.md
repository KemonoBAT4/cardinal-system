# Create the environment for this project:

## Python Virtual Environment:
Here's a small guide to setup a python virtual environment for this project.

1) Setup the environment with this command: `python -m venv <virtual env name>`
2) After this command, a folder called with the same name as you chose in the command should be right above the `app` folder
3) When talking about activating the virtual environment, this depends on your OS:
4) Here's the commands for every specific OS (in a `bash` terminal):
### Windows:
To activate the Virtual Env:
- `source <virtual env name>/Script/activate`

To deactivate the Virtual Env:
- `deactivate`

### Linux / MacOS
To activate the Virtual Env:
- `source <virtual env name>/bin/activate`

To deactivate the Virtual Env:
- `deactivate`

## Using Docker
Using any command in the `./run.sh` will use docker to run the application,
with the `server` + `database` running on different docker containers.
The only requirements is to have `Docker` installed and running on your system
