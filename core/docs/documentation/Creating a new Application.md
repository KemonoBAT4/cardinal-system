# Creating a new Application
Here's a small guide on how to create a new application with Cardinal
Currently there are `1` ways to create a new app, here's the list.

## Methods Available:

### Self creation:
This method allows you to create a new application starting from a template and then expanding it on your own, providing a more flexible and customizable experience than all the other methods. The requirements are pretty specific but are required if you want to take out the best of this

- ##### `Requirements:`
    - A good knowledge of Python is required. You should be familiar with concepts such as classes, objects, decorators, and so on

    - A good knowledge of Flask is required. You should be familiar with concepts such as routes, blueprints, templates, and so on

    - A good knowledge of SQLAlchemy queries is required. You should be familiar with concepts such as model declarations, database queries, and so on

    - A good knowledge of DOcker is required. You should be familiar with concepts like images, containers, Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml, and so on

- ##### `Steps:`
    - Go in the `core/docs/` and copy the `example/` folder
    - In the main filesystem go in the `app/` folder and paste the copied folder
    - Modifiy the files `routes` / `models` / `handlers` / `apis` as you please
    - Right now its not implemented yet a way to auto-generate a `dockcer-compose.yml`. when creating a new app you have to manually create the volumes for the app and the db in the `docker-compose.yml`
    - After doing all of this there wil be the standard commands for running the application (viewvable in the `./run.sh` file description)
