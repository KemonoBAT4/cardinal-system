# Cardinal System

### What is Cardinal 🔭
The idea of cardinal is to create a program that can help creating a backend structure with a complete dashboard to handle taks, manage possible webistes, bots or handle different datas.
Once its core features are completed, Cardinal will be, with some simple commands, able to completely create new applications in the interface, apply some defaults routes, handle users. Once the application is completed, a single Cardinal project installed will be able to run multiple applications simultaneously without, everything with its own database and configurations, but all on the same core.

### Here's an example of the Dashboard

## How to install Cardinal 🖥️
### Production Branch Installation
There is currently not a production branch with a stable way to install & run Cardinal, since its still in development.

### Development Branch Installation
In this first version of Cardinal the first way to start as development an application is the following:

- download the application with the command on a terminal `git clone https://github.com/KemonoBAT4/Cardinal`
- enter the folder with `cd Cardinal`
- make sure to have the docker engine running

- now its possible to run Cardinal, for a list of arguments possible run `python run.py help`
- for a list of all the possible applications run the command `python run.py list`
- for a simple setup of an application, before running it, do `python run.py <application name> setup`
- now its possible to run the command `python run.py <application name> run`

- enabled `./run.sh --help` for a listing all the commands
<!-- - enabled the creation of a dedicated `docker-compose.yml` specific for every application -->


<!--  (- install all the requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt`) -->
<!--  (- run cardinal with `python run.py`) -->
<!--  (- visit the dashboard page `/cardinal/dashboard` to see the dashboard) -->

CONCETTO:
quando faccio il build e poi il deploy si deve creare una copia identica dell'applicazione, dove la parte di database in produzione è staccata da quella di sviluppo
cosi si puo interagire con quella di sviluppo senza toccare l'applicazione in se, perchè poi lo scopo sarebbe di fare il build -> deploy e "inizializzare" il progetto
facendo un setup dell'applicazione in produzione, cosi poi è possibile fare il run e farla partire normalmente
